# ImpactfulSkills
This mod aims to make progression in Valheim, especially skill related progression feel impactful and meaningful. 

In the base game, many skills have a significant impact on how powerful your character is, but that is often not felt due to the slow progression and no milestones that provide feedback.

This mod aims to fix that by providing additional functionality, benefits, or bonuses that occur as you level up.

## Skills and Effects

All of the below effects are configurable! Want it to be more powerful or less power? Its easy to modify through the config file or an in-game config editor!

### Woodcutting

Woodcutting now improves the amount of wood you get from trees and bushes. Along with the amount of seeds, and resin you get.

Woodcutting also gives you increased _chop_ damage, which makes it faster to cut down trees.

| Woodcutting 0 | Woodcutting 50 | Woodcutting 100 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

### Mining (Pickaxes)

Pickaxes now improves the amount of ore and stone you get from mining things. Along with providing an AOE mining effect (which strengthens as you level up) when you get to the requisite level (default 50).


| Pickaxes 0 | Pickaxes 50 | Pickaxes 100 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ![stone_0](https://github.com/MidnightsFX/Valheim_Impactful_Skills/blob/master/ImpactfulSkills/Art/pickaxe_0.gif?raw=true) | ![stone_50](https://github.com/MidnightsFX/Valheim_Impactful_Skills/blob/master/ImpactfulSkills/Art/pickaxe_50.gif?raw=true) | ![stone_100](https://github.com/MidnightsFX/Valheim_Impactful_Skills/blob/master/ImpactfulSkills/Art/pickaxe_100.gif?raw=true) |


### Gathering (Farming)

Gathering increases the bonus number of items you can harvest from any plant. This is partly influenced by luck, and partly influenced by your level.
Additionally at a high level of gathering you gain AOE harvesting (default 50) which increases in range with your skill. 

| Farming 0 | Farming 50 | Farming 100 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ![gather_0](https://github.com/MidnightsFX/Valheim_Impactful_Skills/blob/master/ImpactfulSkills/Art/farming_0.gif?raw=true) | ![gather_50](https://github.com/MidnightsFX/Valheim_Impactful_Skills/blob/master/ImpactfulSkills/Art/farming_50.gif?raw=true) | ![gather_100](https://github.com/MidnightsFX/Valheim_Impactful_Skills/blob/master/ImpactfulSkills/Art/farming_100.gif?raw=true) |

### Sneaking

Increases speed based on your sneaking skill.

### Voyager (new skill)

Voyager increases your potential speed when sailing in a boat. Along with increasing your ability to handle close hauling, when sailing almost against the wind.

### Animal Whisper (new skill)

Taming reduces the amount of time it takes to tame creatures. It also increases the amount of drops you get from killing tamed creatures. Removing the need for massive creature farms.


### Knowledge Sharing

Expertise in one area of knowledge now allows you to gain skills faster in other areas. Being the best builder in the group no longer means you will never level your combat skills.
Changing your primary weapon type now takes considerably less time.


## Roadmap ideas

- Weapon skills reduce stamina cost associated with their weapon
- Crafting can refund costs partially
- Cooking increases the optimal food duration for your character
- Animal whisper allows taming 1 creature permenantly for your character (lvl 100?)
