# ImpactfulSkills
This mod aims to make progression in Valheim, especially skill related progression feel impactful and meaningful. 

In the base game, many skills have a significant impact on how powerful your character is, but that is often not felt due to the slow progression and no milestones that provide feedback.

This mod aims to fix that by providing additional functionality, benefits, or bonuses that occur as you level up.

## Skills and Effects

All of the below effects are configurable! Want it to be more powerful or less power? Its easy to modify through the config file or an in-game config editor!

### Woodcutting

Woodcutting now improves the amount of wood you get from trees and bushes. Along with the amount of seeds, and resin you get.

Woodcutting also gives you increased _chop_ damage, which makes it faster to cut down trees.

| Woodcutting 0 | Woodcutting 50 | Woodcutting 100 |
