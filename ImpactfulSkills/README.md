# ImpactfulSkills
This mod aims to make progression in Valheim, especially skill related progression feel impactful and meaningful. 

In the base game, many skills have a significant impact on how powerful your character is, but that is often not felt due to the slow progression and no milestones that provide feedback.

This mod aims to fix that by providing additional functionality, benefits, or bonuses that occur as you level up.
